        I, Affiq Aqlan Affendi, am the first born son of Affendi and Aishah. A brother 3 younger siblings, well, now only 2..<br/>
        I have been looking for a new career path. Since I was a small boy, I've always had a fascination on how the computer works. I meddled with my father's old laptop back then.
        Opening it up but didn't quite know how to put it back together :)<br/>
        While looking for a career, i stumbled upon an opportunity, one that would bring me to the heart of the Sarawak rainforest. It was there that I had spent a year learning the local language while installing solar PV systems for these villagers.<br/>
        Fast forward to now, I'm learning to code as we speak! (well.. I type, your read)<br/>
        I want to make something of myself. I want to be more than what I am today. I want to achieve the things I set out to do.TBC<br/>
        This is who I am. This is Affiq Aqlan Affendi. <br/>
